    <h1>My project</h1>
    <div id="description">"Among white Americans, one out of every 670 is a physician but among black Americans, only one in 5,000 practices medicine." This figure, quoted in the first of my articles, was an attempt to draw attention to the problem of there not being enough doctors to adequately serve the black population. Why was there such a shortage of African-American doctors?  The causes in the editorial, my first article, were varied in number, but mostly put the blame on African-American college students themselves: a lack of sufficient academic preparation, the belief that their race would be a barrier to having a successful career in medicine,  cost of the necessary education, and ignorance as to the opportunities that becoming a doctor or dentist would afford them: the offered solutions were indicative of the lack of willingness to confront a systemic problem (tutoring, financial assistance, a claim that the American Medical Association had "practically eliminated their racial bars so that Negro physicians are admitted just as others..as soon as properly trained and qualified."

The second article (published first), on the other hand, puts the lie to the stated reasons for the lack of black students in medical programs:  the shortages of black students in medical programs was clearly because they were not being admitted in the first place.  A survey conducted by two John Hopkins professors of Baltimore-area  medical and dental schools revealed a pattern of discrimination against African-American students: during a three-year period, only 3 black students graduated from the John Hopkins medical school, while only 13 African-American students graduated from the University of Maryland - Baltimore medical school.  Why were more African-American students not admitted to medical schools, despite the problem of shortages of qualified medical staff to serve the black population? "Qualifications."

African-American candidates not being academically qualified made for a convenient excuse to deny all but a very highly-performing few admission, despite the almost cheerful assurance in the editorial that tutoring was readily available to help make up any gaps in their knowledge that these students might have had (if only they would try harder): in addition, systemic problems with the continued de facto segregation of schools (despite the still-recent Brown v. Board of Education decision) and accessibility of equal education for African-American students would have contributed to academic deficiencies (a fact which admissions officials surely would have known and could have used as a wedge against all but the most extraordinary students).  This is particularly pertinent today with black students at the University of Maryland - College Park only making up 13.4% of the student population and an administration that does not seem to understand the concerns of the African-American student population and why the school cannot recruit or retain a larger population of black students.

I selected these articles to encode as I was interested in the contrast between the promises held out to African-American students, to make them keep trying in a system that was stacked against them without having to make any lasting structural changes to truly help them and their chances, and the official enforcement of those structural inequalities.  When I encoded the articles, I chose to focus on names and numbers: organization and place names, personal names, and numbers, making them stand out with colors. While no African-American students were named in either article, the personal names found in both were of (presumably) white men in authority positions. Those men were responsible for setting and enforcing policy, as well as providing information that might have given a false sense of hope that there was a way around the barriers set into place, highlighted in green (for invidia, the sin of envy,  from invidere, to look upon with evil intent). Most of my other coloring choices were not nearly so pointed: organization names in blue,  place names in purple, and numbers/numerically-adjacent things (such as enumerating the number of reasons) in red (to make them stand out more).
